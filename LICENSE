## Implementation Basis

All current implementations are based on the following public standards and
documentation:

- Bluetooth Core Specification 5.1 (GATT protocol definitions)
- KT6368A chip public specification documents (FFE0/FFE1/FFE2 services)
- bleak library official documentation and examples
- Home Assistant integration best practices
- Python asyncio programming best practices

Reference materials are documented in `docs/参考资料/` for educational purposes
only. The codebase contains only original implementations derived from these
public standards.

**Git History Note**: As of 2026-02-08, the Git history has been cleaned using
git-filter-repo to remove all previously referenced third-party code and
sensitive files. The current codebase is fully compliant with open-source
best practices.
